Each directory contains a directed graph.
The directory is labeled as numNodes_numEdges in the graph.
The nodes of the graph have distinct id in the closed range [0, numNodes-1].

Inside the directory is a file called `edges.txt` with numEdges lines.
Each line[Format: a<space>b] represents an edge from a to b. Meaning a follows b.

The corresponding file is present in the binary format in a file called `edges.dat`.
The binary representation(big-endian format) of each line is as follows:
<4-bytes-representing-a><4-bytes-representing-b>
[Note that since byte size is fixed, special seperators are not needed]
